**exportAsOpml.js**
Export your tasks as OPML to file "OmniFocusExport.opml" on your desktop.

By default, it exports all non-dropped, non-completed tasks, but those filters can be changed at the top of the script.

It treats folders, projects and tasks all the same, i.e. as nodes in a hierarchy. Currently no metadata is added to the OPML except the name.
